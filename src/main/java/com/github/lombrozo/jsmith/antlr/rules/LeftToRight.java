 * Left to right rule.

 * @todo #99:90min Implement Hight Level Machine For Traversing Rules.
 *  Implement a high-level machine that will traverse the rules and apply correct context to them.
 *  Currently we are required to add classes like {@link LeftToRight} to traverse the rules.
 *  This is not a good approach and we need to implement a high-level machine that will do this.
 *  This should simplify the code and make it more readable.
