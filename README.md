Jsmith is a random Java program generator. The project is largely inspired by
[csmith](https://github.com/csmith-project/csmith), a tool for the C language.
The primary purpose of the library is to provide classes for generating random
Java programs to test Java compilers or translators.

If you need to generate random Java programs for any other purpose, you can also
give Jsmith a try.

## Installation

The library is available on Maven Central. To add it to your project, add the
following snippet to your `pom.xml`:

```xml

<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.volodya-lombrozo</groupId>
  <artifactId>jsmith</artifactId>
  <version>0.0.3</version>
</dependency>
```

## How to Use

The library provides a set of classes for generating random Java programs. To
generate a random class you can use the following code:

```java
import com.github.lombrozo.jsmith.RandomJavaClass;

public class App {
    public static void main(String... args) {
        RandomJavaClass clazz = new RandomJavaClass();
        // Generate source code of the class
        String code = clazz.src();
        System.out.println("Generated code:" + code);
    }
}
```

## Internals

If youâ€™re interested in understanding the internal mechanics of the library, you
can explore the [Under the Hood](docs/under_the_hood.md) guide, which provides
an in-depth explanation of the core design and generation logic. Additionally,
the process of [Semantic-Aware Generation](docs/semantic_aware_generation.md)
explains how the library generates programs with semantic awareness. For more
detailed technical documentation, visit the [docs](docs) directory.
